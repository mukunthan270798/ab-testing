## A/B Testing for Marketing Use Case

The given Dataset contains data collected from a marketing Ad campaign.
The majority of the people were exposed to ads (the experimental group) and a small portion of people (the control group) would instead see a Public Service Announcement (PSA) (or nothing) in the exact size and place the ad would normally be.
The marketing team would like to know which of the version of the ads was successful(higher conversions) with the help of statistical analysis.
